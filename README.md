# Revenue Leakage Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Revenue Leakage Analysis Dashboard** built in **Power BI** to identify, measure, and visualize financial leakages across multiple clients and service categories.  
The goal is to provide a **data-driven view** of where revenue losses are occurring, enabling leadership teams to take corrective actions that directly improve profitability.

---

## 🎯 Objective
In many organizations, revenue leakage occurs due to **under-billing, unpaid invoices, rate mismatches, and unclaimed SLA credits**.  
This dashboard:
- Highlights **total potential leakage** and its key components.
- Pinpoints **top offending clients** causing the most financial impact.
- Provides **time-based trends** for better forecasting and decision-making.
- Allows **interactive filtering** by industry, geography, and time period.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
1. **Top KPI Cards**
   - **Total Potential Leakage** – Overall loss amount.
   - **Under-billed Hours**
   - **Unpaid Invoices**
   - **Rate Mismatch**
   - **Unclaimed SLA Credits**

2. **Leakage Composition Chart**
   - Stacked column chart showing category-wise leakage for each client.

3. **Top Offenders**
   - Horizontal bar chart listing clients with the highest total leakage.

4. **Detailed Audit Table**
   - Drill-down table with client-level and category-level details.

5. **Trend Analysis**
   - Line chart to visualize leakage over time (Month/Quarter/Year).

6. **Interactive Slicers**
   - Industry, Country, and Date filters for targeted insights.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – Data visualization & dashboard creation
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For custom measures
- **Microsoft Excel** – Initial data cleaning
- **GitHub** – Version control & project showcasing

## 📈 Insights & Key Takeaways
- **High-Risk Clients:**  
  A small group of clients contributes disproportionately to total leakage, requiring urgent contractual and operational reviews.
  
- **Category Analysis:**  
  Unpaid invoices and under-billed hours account for the majority of revenue loss.
  
- **Geographic Impact:**  
  Leakage patterns vary by region, with certain countries showing consistently higher unpaid amounts.
  
- **Trend Monitoring:**  
  Leakage is stable overall but spikes during contract renewals or billing cycle transitions.

## 📌 Business Value
By implementing this dashboard:
- Finance teams can **recover lost revenue** by targeting the most impactful leakage sources.
- Operations teams can **improve billing accuracy** and contract compliance.
- Leadership can **monitor trends** and prioritize high-risk accounts.

---

##🧠 Insights & Value (typical outcomes)

-A small set of clients often drives a large share of leakage → prioritize top offenders first.
-Under-billed hours and unpaid invoices are the most common drivers.
-Trend view reveals spikes near renewals/billing cycle changes → add pre-invoice checks.

---

##🛠️ Future Enhancements

-Live refresh from a database/warehouse (scheduled refresh)
-Alerts (email/Teams) when leakage crosses thresholds
-Root-cause drilldowns (roles, projects, geos)
-Predictive risk scoring (which contracts will leak next)
-Approval workflow to auto-create credit/debit adjustments
