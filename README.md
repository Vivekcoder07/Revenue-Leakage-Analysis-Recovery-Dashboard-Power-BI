# Revenue Leakage Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a **Revenue Leakage Analysis Dashboard** built in **Power BI** to identify, measure, and visualize financial leakages across multiple clients and service categories.  
The goal is to provide a **data-driven view** of where revenue losses are occurring, enabling leadership teams to take corrective actions that directly improve profitability.

This dashboard:
- Highlights **total potential leakage** and its key components.
- Pinpoints **top offending clients** causing the most financial impact.
- Provides **time-based trends** for better forecasting and decision-making.
- Allows **interactive filtering** by industry, geography, and time period.
